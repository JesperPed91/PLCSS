# PLCSS Mini Project group MTA-17334

To open and use the server and client: 

Server: 
Download the project as a .zip, unzip everything and open the folder MiniProjectServer and then open MiniProjectServer.sln, with Visual Studio you will only have to run it (click on "Local Windows Debugger") And then windows should prompt you to allow access press "allow access" or "tillad adgang" now the server will be running. 

Client: 
Same procedure for opening the project as written for the server above. 
In the code, change the variable: string ipAddress = "your ipv4 adress"; to be able to connect to the server. 
Multiple instances of the client can be run to showcase the use of multiple clients. Each client's console window will show the messages from all the clients connected to the server.
